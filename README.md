## Self-Reflection:

I had a lot of problems trying to get this to work. First, it was getting the value from the Promise object at the beginning, then it was trying to get the wrong guesses and unknown letters to work properly, and lastly was figuring out how the Canvas API worked. However, with enough debugging and examining the console, I found the solutions, and got a pretty good project. I didn't bother with the CSS animations because I already have enough troubles trying to get this to work.

### How long it took me to finish this?

4-5 hours
